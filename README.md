# AI_Virtual_Mouse

The hand gesture virtual mouse using Python is an innovative application that allows users to control their computer cursor using hand movements. By leveraging computer vision and machine learning techniques, it captures the webcam feed, detects hand gestures, and translates them into mouse actions. This intuitive and interactive system enhances user experience and opens up new possibilities for natural human-computer interaction.

### Tech Stacks:üíª
- OpenCV (for image processing and drawing)
- Mediapipe (for Hand Tracking)
- PyAutoGui (for controlling mouse movement and click)
- Numpy
